# Conways-Game-of-Life

Created for the Introduction to Object Oriented Programming with Java class at Anoka Ramsey Community College. 

Conway's Game of Life is a popular programming challenge that I decided to re-create graphically in Java. 
Rules for the game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
